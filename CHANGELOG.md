# Change Log

All notable changes to the "LPC Language Support" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.4] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed
- **Binary Operator Spacing in One-liners**: Fixed missing spaces around operators in one-liner statements
  - Added proper spacing for `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` operators (e.g., `arg+"_aptness"` → `arg + "_aptness"`)
  - Added proper spacing for compound assignment operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.
  - Multiple normalization passes handle partially-spaced operators

- **String Content Protection**: Fixed operators being incorrectly modified inside string literals
  - Paths like `"/std/object"` no longer get spaces added (was becoming `" / std/object"`)
  - Format specifiers like `"%s"` preserved correctly in strings
  - Context-aware operator patterns exclude quotes where appropriate

- **Comment Content Protection**: Fixed operator spacing being applied inside comments
  - Comment content now separated before normalization is applied
  - Prevents comments like `// Post-increment` from becoming `// Post - increment`
  - String-aware comment detection avoids false positives from quotes in strings

- **One-liner else-if Preservation**: Fixed `else if` statements being incorrectly split
  - Pattern detection now handles `else if(...)` syntax properly
  - Closing braces on `else if` one-liners stay on same line

- **Consistent Inline Comment Spacing**: Standardized spacing before inline comments
  - Lines ending with `{` get 1 space before comment
  - All other inline comments get 4 spaces for consistency
  - Removed complex alignment logic in favor of simple, predictable spacing

## [1.2.3] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed
- **Brace Indentation with Comments**: Fixed incorrect indentation when opening brace has inline comment
  - Opening braces followed by comments (e.g., `{ // comment`) now correctly detected
  - Changed exact match check to prefix check for brace detection
  - Prevents extra indentation level being added after if statements with commented braces

- **One-liner Statement Preservation**: Fixed one-liner if/while/for/foreach statements being incorrectly split
  - One-liner control statements now preserved intact (e.g., `if(x) { return y; }`)
  - Improved pattern detection to handle complex nested function calls in conditions
  - Simplified detection logic to check for keyword and brace presence instead of parsing parentheses

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed
- **Critical: Comment Content Now Ignored During Formatting**: Fixed formatter counting brackets/braces inside comments
  - Comments (`//` and `/* */`) are now completely ignored when counting brackets for indentation
  - Prevents indentation corruption when comments contain code-like syntax
  - Added comprehensive comment skip logic in both bracket-counting loops
  - Added preprocessor comment filtering for `; }` pattern detection
  - Test cases added to verify comments don't leak formatting logic

- **Function Name Highlighting**: Fixed function declarations not being syntax-highlighted
  - Function names in declarations now properly colored (e.g., `void test_function()`)
  - Moved function pattern matching earlier in grammar processing order
  - Simplified regex pattern for better reliability

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **Macro/Constant Highlighting**: Enhanced syntax highlighting for preprocessor macros and constants
  - All-uppercase identifiers (3+ characters) now highlighted as constants (e.g., `BUFFER_SIZE`, `WL_NAME`)
  - Double-underscore macros highlighted (e.g., `__DEBUG__`, `__MASTER__`)
  - Macro names in `#define` statements now properly highlighted
  - Makes it easy to distinguish constants/macros from regular variables

### Fixed
- **Closing Parenthesis Alignment**: Fixed indentation for closing parentheses in deeply nested lambda/closure structures
  - Closing `)` now correctly aligns with the line containing the matching opening `(`
  - Fixed bracket stack matching to search for parentheses specifically, not just any bracket type
  - Added special handling for `#'[` operator syntax to prevent bracket stack interference
  - Resolves issues with functions like `write_file(implode(map(lambda(...))))` having misaligned closing brackets

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **Comprehensive Whitespace Normalization**: Advanced spacing rules for consistent code formatting
  - Remove extra spaces before semicolons, closing parentheses, and opening braces
  - Normalize spaces after opening parentheses
  - Standardize spacing in type declarations
  - Clean up compound operators (==, !=, <=, >=, +=, -=, etc.)
  - Proper spacing around assignment operators
  - Function reference operator `#'` spacing normalization
  - String concatenation spacing
  - Inline closure `(: ... :)` spacing
  - **Case statement normalization**: Single space after `case`, no space before `:`
- **Enhanced Syntax Highlighting**: Function pointers now properly highlighted
  - Function references like `#'function_name` now colored as function entities
  - Operator function references like `#'=`, `#'+`, etc. also highlighted
  - Improved pattern matching order for better syntax recognition

### Fixed
- **Critical String Protection**: String literal contents are now completely protected from modification
  - Character-by-character state tracking with escape sequence handling
  - Regex replacements only applied to code outside of strings
  - Tested with complex multi-space patterns inside strings
- Spaces removed after opening parentheses following LDMUD conventions
- Multiple spaces in case labels normalized (e.g., `case  1:` → `case 1:`)
- Space before colon in case statements removed (e.g., `case 2 :` → `case 2:`)
- Spacing between `})` and `)` in nested closures/arrays

### Improved
- Zero-diff formatting achieved on 1029-line comprehensive test file
- More robust code/string boundary detection
- Better handling of LDMUD closure syntax `({'symbol})`, `({#'func})`, `({ values })`
- Enhanced formatting consistency across all LPC language constructs

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **K&R Function Brace Style**: Function opening braces now appear on the same line as the declaration (industry standard)
- **Always-Braces Mode**: Enhanced safety with braces required for all single-statement bodies
- **Industry-Standard Block Comments**: Aligned asterisk formatting for multi-line comments
  - Automatic ` * ` formatting for continuation lines
  - Smart detection of inline vs. multi-line comments
  - Proper spacing for opening `/*` and closing `*/`
- **Comma Spacing Normalization**: Multiple spaces after commas automatically collapsed to single space

### Fixed
- Switch case label indentation now properly maintained across multiple case statements
- Block comment state tracking no longer interferes with code indentation
- Inline comments `/* ... */` on same line no longer trigger block comment mode
- LPC structure brackets `({`, `})`, `([`, `])`, `(<`, `>)` correctly excluded from bracket stack
- Function body indentation after K&R brace merging
- Switch state persistence through nested control structures

### Improved
- More robust switch statement handling with proper state tracking
- Better alignment for closing parentheses and brackets
- Enhanced continuation line detection for complex expressions
- Improved formatting consistency across 929 lines of test code
